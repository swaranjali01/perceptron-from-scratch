# ðŸ§  Perceptron from Scratch using NumPy

This is part of my DeepLearning journey.  
 I implemented a Perceptron model (linear binary classifier) using only NumPy 

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Used
- Python 3.x  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside
- Manual implementation of:
  - Perceptron forward pass
  - Weight & bias updates
  - Step activation function
- Binary classification on a toy dataset
- Visualization of decision boundary

---

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- How gradient-based updates improve model performance
- What linear separability means in classification
- Difference between theory and actual implementation
